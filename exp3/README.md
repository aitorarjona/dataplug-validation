# FASTQGzip chunk size probing with zero-cost repartitioning experiment

This notebook implements the probing experiment of the FASTQGZip dataset. The aim is to measure the time it takes to process a chunk of data from the dataset of varying size, in order to check which is the optimal chunk size for parallel processing.

Follow the instructions provided in the notebook.

You can use large files from the dataset in **exp1** for this experiment. Data must be pre-processed first.

Good luck!
