# Dataplug experiments

This repository contains the code to reproduce the experiments to validate [Dataplug](https://github.com/CLOUDLAB-URV/dataplug).

The experiments are divided into the following folders:
- **Experiment 1**: [Comparison between static partitioning and pre-processing with Dataplug for FASTQGZip data](exp1/)
- **Experiment 2**: [Chunk retreival latency comparison between static chunks and dynamic partitioning for FASTQGZip data](exp2/)
- **Experiment 3**: [FASTQGzip chunk size probing with zero-cost repartitioning experiment](exp3/)
- **Experiment 4**: [Preprocessing comparison between Cloud-optimized and Dataplug for LiDAR data](exp4/)
- **Experiment 5**: [Geospatial workflow with an autoscaling Ray cluster](exp5/)

Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or suggestions. Good luck!
